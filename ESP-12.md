# ESP-12 Boards

The ESP-12 board is a widely used wifi based micro-controller from Espressif Systems. This micro-controller is the heart of IoT based projects and it is widely used by the Home Automation industry. Here you'll find the resources for the ESP-12 boards so that you can make the hardware based on these boards and integrate it with SmarDen Dashboard. We're using Arduino IDE here and this guide will help you to get started with the ESP12 boards with Arduino IDE and integrate it with the SmarDen Dashboard.
